# 🤖 CNC Machine Abnormality Detection using Feature Selection and Classification

This project focuses on detecting abnormalities in CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines using machine learning. We apply feature selection techniques using a correlation matrix to improve model performance in classifying abnormal vs. normal behavior.
A machine learning project to detect abnormalities in CNC machines using feature selection and classification models.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal is to analyze sensor data from CNC machines and detect anomalies through correlation matrix-based feature selection and classification models.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect abnormal patterns in CNC machine operation
- Use correlation matrix to reduce feature redundancy
- Train classification models for anomaly detection

## 🧠 Tools & Technology

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy
- Algorithms: Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree

## 📊 Feature Selection Process

- Use correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features
- Drop redundant features to avoid overfitting
- Use selected features to train ML models

## 🧪 Classification Results

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Random Forest | 96%      | 95%       | 97%    |
| SVM           | 92%      | 91%       | 90%    |
